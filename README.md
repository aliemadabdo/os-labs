# Operating Systems Labs - Alexandria University

This repository contains a series of lab assignments completed during the Operating Systems course at Alexandria University. These labs are designed to reinforce the theoretical concepts covered in the course through hands-on coding and problem-solving. Below is a brief overview of each lab and instructions for getting started.

## Lab Topics

### Lab 1: Simple Shell
- **Directory:** `lab1-simple-shell`
- **Description:** In this lab, we implement a basic shell with the ability to execute commands and handle pipelining.

### Lab 2: Multi-threaded Matrix Multiplication
- **Directory:** `lab2-matrix-multiplication`
- **Description:** This lab focuses on developing a multi-threaded program to perform matrix multiplication, highlighting thread creation and synchronization techniques.

### Lab 3: Mutual Exclusion (California Train Algorithm)
- **Directory:** `lab3-mutual-exclusion`
- **Description:** In this lab, we solve the mutual exclusion problem using the "California train" algorithm, demonstrating process synchronization.
